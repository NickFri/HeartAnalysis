# HeartPHI

This software, leveraging an ESP32 microcontroller and a specialized ECG board, captures raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data to monitor heart activity. It features a versatile interface with eight different windows, each displaying various data and graphs derived from the ECG readings. Key functionalities include performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the ECG data to analyze its frequency components and executing a cepstral analysis to identify dominant fractal frequencies. This dual FFT approach helps determine the compatibility of frequency patterns within the heart data.

Additionally, the software measures Heart Rate Variability (HRV), offering further insights into heart health by analyzing the HRV's frequency content. Users can interact with this data through customizable graphs, enabling them to consciously influence their HRV by introducing specific frequencies. Various modes are available for this purpose, enhancing user engagement and personalization.

Moreover, the software provides historical graphs to track changes in the cepstral data over time, offering a longitudinal view of heart health. An interactive game screen further enriches the experience, allowing users to incorporate specific frequency sets into their heart rhythm in a gamified manner.

A standout feature is the ability to share cepstrum data over the internet, facilitating collaborative experiences and comparisons with others in a public game room. This unique combination of detailed heart data analysis, interactive features, and online connectivity makes this software a comprehensive and innovative tool for heart health monitoring and engagement.
